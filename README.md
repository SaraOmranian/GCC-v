# GCC-v

### Greedy Clustering Coefficient and its Variants

GCC-v is a network clustering algorithm that can be used to find protein complexes from protein-protein interaction networks(PPINs). Depending on weather you want to consider the weights of interactions into the algorithm or you want to find overlapping clusters, the four versions are introduced. To calculate the node score, one can use 

GCC-v is written in python. The algorithm is parameter-free thereby there is no need to pass any variables to the function.

To run the program you need to call main_Function.py and pass your network to that.

You can find PPINs for S. cerevisiae, H. sapiens, and escherichia coli (E. coli)  with their gold standards in their respective folders.
